## Improvements
The improvements which can be made to the project is to have the option to help establish a far simpler helper class. 
There many parts where our naming convention is not consistent and lacks clarity. We should follow a format to make it easy to read everyone's code.
Another improvement would be to profile the java application as this will show any potential bottlenecks within the programme. 


With regard to the UML diagram, the composition and aggregation that is presented is correctly done.
There is no problem with the relationship except for the one-to-one relationship between student and student address 
because it is possible for a student to have more than one address.


Employee and student could be abstracted in an interface or an abstract class since they contain similar attributes.
